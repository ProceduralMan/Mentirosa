An alternative to the archived Faker library from François Zaninotto


On October, 2020 François Zaninotto decided to arcvhive his wonderful Faker library

He wrote an article explaining the reasons -https://marmelab.com/blog/2020/10/21/sunsetting-faker.html-

Reasons boil down to three:
 - He no longer is working on PHP
 - Moderating localised content was a nightmare
 - Library was pretty heavy
 
 This library tries to be an alternative to faker that solves the technical issues
 
 Library is in pre-alpha state, will change to alpha as sonn as the first primitives are ready
